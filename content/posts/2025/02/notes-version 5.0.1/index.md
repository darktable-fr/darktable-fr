We're proud to announce the new bug-fix release of darktable, 5.0.1!

The github release is here: https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.0.1.

To build from source, do not use the autogenerated tarball provided by GitHub on the release page, download our tar.xz file instead. If you're just building for yourself without creating a package for some distribution, then using source code cloning in git is an even more convenient way.

The checksums are:

$ sha256sum darktable-5.0.1.tar.xz
??? darktable-5.0.1.tar.xz

$ sha256sum darktable-5.0.1-x86_64.dmg

??? darktable-5.0.1-win64.exe

$ sha256sum darktable-5.0.1-x86_64.AppImage
???  darktable-5.0.1-x86_64.AppImage

When updating from the stable 4.8 series, please bear in mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new library and configuration will no longer be usable with 4.8.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.
Important note: to make sure that Darktable can keep on supporting the raw file format for your camera, please read this post on how/what raw samples you can contribute to ensure that we have the full raw sample set for your camera under CC0 license!

The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to Darktable 5.0.1. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual changes (where available).

    N/A

UI/UX Improvements

    N/A

Performance Improvements

    Improved performance of discarding history of selected images.

Other Changes

    Harmonized style selection in print settings with the update made in the export module for release 5.0.

    Darktable now includes the Lensfun database into the AppImage.

    Center collapsible module section labels.

Bug Fixes

    Fixed a scrolling bug in the collections module where the collection tree was not scrolled to the previous position when returning from darkroom.

    Fix crash when attempting to move up the top or only shape in a group in the mask manager.

    Fix collection module when using the "module" filter which was listing none of the processing modules.

    Fix iop-order user presets use. It was not possible to get a user's iop-order preset to be applied as the Darktable internal presets where always picked up first.

    Fixed a crash in variable expansion for $(SEQUENCE[n,m]).

    Fixed handling on click from filmstrip when in map and print view. On map we now properly center the image on the map. On the print view, we use the selected image as content of the main print area.

    Fixed a regression introduced in 5.0.0 where we lost the ability to read 2-channel TIFF files and files with more than 4 channels. This fix allows them to be read by the TIFF loader, whereas previously the TIFF loader rejected such files and they were loaded by a fallback loader (GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick).

    Fixed not being able to pan with a mouse in the zoomable layout.

    Fixed possibly collapsing the module header when restoring defaults.

    Fixed a case of XMP being written without actual image modification.

    Fixed a crash of Darktable when reimporting XMP having overlay images referenced.

    Fixed the support for single lib module opened at a time when in darkroom.

    Fixed xmp sidecar writing while working as a gimp plugin.

    Fixed issues when applying a style in darkroom using the Styles module.

    Fixed a possible crash when using Ctrl+z reproduced on macOS.

    Fixed Darktable crashing in enlarge-canvas module.

    Fixed Darktable crashing using details mask due to bad tiling.

    Fixed a hash calculation bug leading to pixelpipe instabilities.

    Fixed issue to handle auto-presets when the focal length is greater then 1000.

    Fixed crash on macOS when closing the darkroom's second window.

    Fixed possible jump in filmstrip when entering darkroom from full preview.

    Fixed a performance regression in haze removal module.

    Fixed reading palette-based PNG with transparency.

    Fixed possible crash in lens correction module when changing camera and/or lens model.

    Fixed crash after deleting style or preset that was selected in shortcuts dialog.

    Fixed a crash when the currently active module instance is being deleted.

    We now support the correct orientation for JPEG XL if it was specified in the format's metadata but not in Exif (or Exif is missing). We also avoid over-transformation if it is specified in both the basic data and Exif.
